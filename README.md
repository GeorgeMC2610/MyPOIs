# My Points Of Interest

This is project is an implementation of the **first assignment** of the lecture "Current Topics of Software Engineering". **The goal was to make an Android Application that would save Points Of Interest based on location.**

<br>

## How it Works

Every P.O.I. (Point Of Interest) has five attributes:
+ Title
+ Category
+ Description
+ Timestamp
+ Location (Latitude, Longitude)

The P.O.I.s are saved to a local database, and then, the user will be able to scroll through them. 
The user must be able to perform at least the following actions:

+ Add a P.O.I.
+ Edit a P.O.I.
+ Remove a P.O.I.
+ See All P.O.I.s
+ Search for a P.O.I.
